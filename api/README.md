## Migrations

Here’s what each command does and when you should use it:

### **1. `migration:run`**

```bash
npm run migration:run
```

**What does it do?**  
This command runs all pending migrations in the database. It applies the changes defined in migration files (usually in the `src/migrations` folder) that have not yet been applied.

**When to use?**

- After creating new migrations and needing to apply them to the database.
- When setting up an environment (e.g., local, staging, or production) and ensuring the database schema is up to date.

---

### **2. `migration:generate`**

```bash
npm run migration:generate --name add-status-to-user
```

**What does it do?**  
This command automatically generates a migration file based on detected changes in the TypeORM entity schema. It compares the current database state with the entities defined in the code.

**When to use?**

- When you modify entities (e.g., add or remove columns/tables) and need to create a corresponding migration file.

---

### **3. `migration:create`**

```bash
npm run migration:create --name rename-user-table
```

**What does it do?**  
This command creates an empty migration file. Unlike `migration:generate`, it does not automatically analyze entities. It is useful when you need to manually write migration logic.

**When to use?**

- When creating a custom migration that cannot be generated automatically.
- For complex cases such as specific SQL executions or data manipulation.

---

### **4. `migration:revert`**

```bash
npm run migration:revert
```

**What does it do?**  
This command reverts the last migration applied to the database. It uses the logic defined in the `down` method of each migration to undo changes.

**When to use?**

- When you applied a migration incorrectly and need to roll it back.
- For testing purposes, when you need to undo database changes after validating a migration.
